## MacroBTC Forecasting App

## Project Overview
**MacroBTC** is a Streamlit web application that predicts Bitcoin prices using macroeconomic indicators such as inflation, interest rates, and global money supply. It blends modern machine learning with economic fundamentals to offer an intuitive, interactive crypto forecasting tool.

The motivation behind this project is my interest in understanding how monetary policy, inflation, and liquidity affect Bitcoinâ€™s price movements, and using machine learning to make predictions. The domain interest this project focuses on is financial markets and cryptocurrency analysis. There are many other crypto forecasting models, but most rely on technical analysis rather than macroeconomic fundamentals, making this project a unique approach.

## Problem Statement
Bitcoin price movements are notoriously volatile and often driven by speculation. Many existing models focus only on crypto-specific indicators, ignoring the potential influence of real-world economic conditions. This project explores the question:

> *Can macroeconomic indicators improve the accuracy of Bitcoin price predictions?*

## ðŸ’¡ Solution
This app combines data from both crypto markets and traditional economic sources to build a machine learning model (XGBoost Regressor) capable of forecasting Bitcoin prices. Users can explore data relationships, generate predictions, and view model results in a clean, user-friendly dashboard.
